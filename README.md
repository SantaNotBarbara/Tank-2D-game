# Tank-2D-game
simple game simulation based on a 2D map where the user (player) can move in four main directions: right, left, up, and down. There is no GUI yet, but the aim is to design all the necessary components and structure them in a way so that it can serve as a base for some more specific game types. 

This project was made for a better understanding of Java. 
You can improve it with the addition of a new map and a choice of difficulty. 
The player currently has 5 lives before losing. We need to add smoother animation.

  If you are a student of SDU, don't even try to pass off this work as yours :)
